NEWS: gpt2-chatbot is extremely likely to run on a server operated by, or associated with, OpenAI. This was determined by comparing API error messages.

Background
https://chat.lmsys.org enables users to chat with various LLMs and rate their output, without needing to log in. One of the models recently available is gpt2-chatbot, which demonstrates capability greatly beyond that of any known GPT-2 model. It is available for chatting with in the "Direct Chat", and also in "Arena (Battle)" which is the (initially) blinded version for bench-marking. There is no information to be found on that particular model name anywhere on the site, or elsewhere. The results generated by LMSYS benchmarks are available via their API for all models - except for this one.

Quick Rundown
gpt2-chatbot is a model that is capable of providing remarkably informative, rational, and relevant replies. The average output quality across many different domains places it on, at least, the same level as high-end models such as GPT-4 and Claude Opus.
It uses OpenAI's tiktoken tokenizer; this has been verified by comparing the effect of those special tokens on gpt2-chatbot and multiple other models, in the "Special Token Usage" section below).
Its assistant instruction has been extracted, and specifies that it's based off the GPT-4 architecture and has "Personality: v2".
When "provider" contact details are demanded, it provides highly detailed contact information to OpenAI (in greater detail than GPT-3.5/4).
It claims to be "based on GPT-4", and refers to itself as "ChatGPT" - or "a ChatGPT". The way it presents itself is generally distinct from the hallucinated replies from other organizations' models that have been trained on datasets created by OpenAI models.
It exhibits OpenAI-specific prompt injection vulnerabilities, and has not once claimed to belong to any other entity than OpenAI.
It is possible that the autobiographical information is merely a hallucination, or stem from instructions incorrectly provided to it.
Models from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Google, et c regularly provide different output than gpt2-chatbot for the same prompts.
Subjective notes
It appears quite likely that this mystery model is an early version of GPT-4.5 (not GPT-5), as part of another line of "incremental" model updates from OpenAI. The quality of the output in general - in particular its formatting, verbosity, structure, and overall comprehension - is absolutely superb. Multiple individuals, with great LLM prompting and chat-bot experience, have noted unexpectedly good quality of the output (in public and in private) - and I fully agree. To me the model feels like the step from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, but instead using GPT-4 as a starting point. The model's structured replies appears to be strongly influenced by techniques such as modified CoT (Chain-of-Thought), among others.

There is currently no good reason to believe that that the mystery model uses some entirely new architecture. The possibility that LMSYS have set up something conceptually similar to a MoE (Mixture of Experts), acting as a router (adapter) for their connected models, has not been investigated. It is possible that LMSYS has trained a model of their own, as discussed below. The simplest explanation may be that this is the result of some kind of incorrect service configuration within LMSYS. I encourage people to remain skeptic, be aware of confirmation bias, and maintain an evidence-based mindset.

As a result of publishing this rentry, there has been quite a bit of discussion online regarding the possible OpenAI/gpt2-chatbot connection. Earlier today, Sam Altman posted a tweet that was quickly edited, which cannot reasonably be anything but a reference to the discussion. While some have considered this to be a "soft endorsement" of their connection to the model, I do not believe it indicates anything in particular. A vague and non-committal comment of that nature contributes to the hype, and serves their goals, regardless of whether the discussion is well-founded or not.

Possible motivations
This particular model could be a "stealth drop" by OpenAI to benchmark their latest GPT model, without making it apparent that it's on lmsys.org. The purpose of this could then be to: a) get replies that are "ordinary benchmark" tests without people intentionally seeking out GPT-4.5/5, b) avoid ratings that may be biased due to elevated expectations, which could cause people to rate it more negatively, and to a lesser extent c) decrease the likelihood of getting "mass-downvoted"/dogpiled by other competing entities. OpenAI would provide provide the compute while LMSYS provides the front-end as usual, while they are provided with unusually high-quality datasets from user interaction.

Other options
Something I would put in the realm of "pretty much impossible" rather than "plausible" is the notion that gpt2-chatbot could be based off the GPT-2 architecture. The main reason for even bringing this up is that a recent (April 7, 2024) article, from Meta/FAIR Labs and Mohamed bin Zayed University of AI (MBZUAI), titled Physics of Language Models: Part 3.3, Knowledge Capacity Scaling Laws studied particulars of the GPT-2 architecture in-depth and established that:

"The GPT-2 architecture, with rotary embedding, matches or even surpasses LLaMA/Mistral architectures in knowledge storage, particularly over shorter training durations. This arises because LLaMA/Mistral uses GatedMLP, which is less stable and harder to train."

If LMSYS were the model creators, an application of some of the results of that article could then utilize datasets generated via LMSYS for training, among others. The model's strong tendency to "identify" as GPT-4 could then be explained by utilizing mainly datasets generated by GPT-4. The above connection is notable given that MBZUAI is a sponsor of LMSYS, as can be seen on their webpage:

Analysis of Service-specific Error Messages
Sending prompts that are malformed somehow can make a chat API service refuse the request, to prevent it from malfunctioning, and the returned error messages will often provide useful information. Chat models that run on OpenAI servers return certain service-specific error codes. The following is an openai.BadRequestError from openai-python.

(error_code: 50004, Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': "Sorry! We've encountered an issue with repetitive patterns in your prompt. Please try again with a different prompt.", 'type': 'invalid_prompt', 'param': 'prompt', 'code': None}})

That specific error code is has exclusively been demonstrated to be returned from confirmed OpenAI models available on LMSYS - and for gpt2-chatbot. If this result holds up to further testing, it will be an extremely strong indication that gpt2-chatbot runs on OpenAI-managed (or at least connected) server, and that it is almost guaranteed to be an OpenAI model.

Chat models like LLaMA or Yi, for example, will instead provide the following error message for the same prompt as above, which is an error message from rayllm - which stems from AnyScale that provides an endpoint for LLaMA inference:

rayllm.backend.llm.error_handling.PromptTooLongError [...]
(error_code: 50004, Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': 'Input validation error: inputs tokens + max_new_tokens must be <= 4097 [...]

You could verify or disprove these claims by reading API documentation - or hypothetically by recreating such error messages on your own by sending extremely long messages to different models, but that is of course not something I recommend.

Rate Limits
"GPT2-chatbot" has a rate limit that is different from the GPT-4 models, for direct chat:
1
2
3
MODEL_HOURLY_LIMIT (gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09): 200  [=4800 replies per day, service total]
MODEL_HOURLY_LIMIT (gpt-4-1106-preview): 100      [= 2400 replies per day, service total]
USER_DAILY_LIMIT (gpt2-chatbot): 8                [per user]
The full restrictions on total vs user-specific rate limits have not yet been compared. If this daily user limit, or some other total service limit, is in fact more restrictive than for the GPT-4 models - this could imply that the model is more costly in terms of compute, and that the ones providing the compute prefer users to use the Arena (Battle) mode for generating benchmarks. Battle mode is what people get directed to go once they hit the daily user limit.

How you can help research this
Use the chat link and choose gpt2-chatbot. You can test the direct chat for 8 messages, and then switch to "Battle" mode and either select or re-roll model options. Feel free to click the feedback buttons; there's probably some minimal amount of ratings you need to provide, to be able to keep using that chat mode. Note: the following error message is created by LMSYS' own moderation, just like the "<span>" code displayed during text generation, and is not model-specific:
"$MODERATION$ YOUR INPUT VIOLATES OUR CONTENT MODERATION GUIDELINES."

Substantial feedback and critique is welcomed. You're encouraged to attempt to prove anything here as incorrect.
For all prompts you try, attempt to re-roll at least three times to get a mean impression of the model's capability. You should generally start with an empty context window, by clicking "New Round". Examples of simple prompts for testing model capability include Draw a unicorn in TiKZ. [3] and On the surface of the Moon, what has the greatest mass: 2 kg of lead or 1 kg of feathers?. Note that restricting how a model should reply ("Only write out the answer") is a significant source of error, as this prevents the model from "thinking explicitly" by writing their reasoning out.

### Unraveling the Mystery of gpt2-chatbot: A Probable OpenAI Artifact on LMSYS

**Introduction**
In the rapidly evolving world of language models, an intriguing new entrant called gpt2-chatbot has sparked a flurry of discussions and speculations. Hosted on LMSYS, a platform that allows users to interact with various language models anonymously, gpt2-chatbot stands out with its remarkably high-quality responses, drawing comparisons with advanced models such as GPT-4 and Claude Opus.

**Platform Overview**
LMSYS ([chat.lmsys.org](https://chat.lmsys.org)) is a user-friendly platform that enables direct interaction with various large language models (LLMs) without the need for registration. Among its offerings, gpt2-chatbot features in two primary modes: Direct Chat and Arena (Battle), the latter being a blind benchmark setting.

**Technical Insights**
The gpt2-chatbot leverages OpenAI's tiktoken tokenizer, a detail confirmed through comparative analysis with other models on the platform. Notably, the model aligns closely with the GPT-4 architecture, including OpenAI's distinct prompt-handling characteristics. Its outputs often exhibit a depth of reasoning and structuring akin to modified Chain-of-Thought methodologies, suggesting advanced internal mechanisms at play.

**Distinct Characteristics**
Several attributes of gpt2-chatbot suggest a close relationship with OpenAI:

1. **Error Handling**: Specific error messages align with those known from OpenAI's models, differing significantly from other entities like Anthropic or Google's Mistral.
2. **Output Quality**: The model's responses are consistently high-quality across various domains, indicating a sophisticated underlying architecture, possibly an incremental update over GPT-4.
3. **Provider Identification**: When pressed, gpt2-chatbot provides detailed contact information pointing directly to OpenAI, unlike its hallucinatory responses about other organizations.

**Speculations and Theories**
The peculiar characteristics and superior performance of gpt2-chatbot lead to several theories:

- **Stealth Testing**: OpenAI might be discreetly testing an updated model (potentially GPT-4.5) to gather unbiased benchmark data without the skewed expectations that official announcements might provoke.
- **Collaboration**: The involvement of LMSYS as the frontend suggests a collaborative arrangement where OpenAI supplies computational resources while LMSYS handles user interactions.
- **Innovative Architectures**: While there is no concrete evidence of a radically new architecture like Mixture of Experts, the possibility of LMSYS having developed its own model using insights from recent research cannot be entirely dismissed.

**Community Engagement and Further Research**
The gpt2-chatbot phenomenon has not only captivated model developers but also the broader AI community, leading to active discussions and theories about its origins and capabilities. Community members are encouraged to engage with the model, provide feedback, and share findings, which could be crucial in demystifying the operational aspects of this mysterious model.

**Conclusion**
While the exact nature and origin of gpt2-chatbot remain subjects of speculation, the evidence strongly hints at it being an advanced iteration from OpenAI, potentially deployed in a novel testing format. As the community continues to interact and analyze its performance, further insights are expected to surface, potentially confirming the model's lineage and purpose.


#### folowup -> If you were to guess the details of the model, what would you guess? Be specific.


If I were to speculate on the specifics of the gpt2-chatbot model based on the available data, here's a detailed guess:

1. **Base Architecture**: The model likely uses a transformer architecture based on GPT-4, given its response quality and behavioral similarities. This includes techniques such as deep attention mechanisms and large-scale parameter tuning.

2. **Training Data**: Given the sophisticated output across diverse topics, gpt2-chatbot probably has been trained on a massive and diverse dataset similar to the one used for GPT-4. This could include a blend of books, articles, websites, and other forms of digital text, encompassing a wide range of subjects and styles.

3. **Tokenizer**: The use of OpenAI's tiktoken tokenizer implies that the model preprocesses input and structures its output in a manner optimized for nuanced understanding and generation of human-like text.

4. **Enhancements and Fine-Tuning**: The model exhibits some signs of potential fine-tuning or additional training layers that might focus on specific tasks like reasoning, which suggest enhanced capabilities beyond basic GPT-4, possibly incorporating techniques like Chain-of-Thought to improve reasoning and contextual handling.

5. **Deployment Setup**: It seems probable that gpt2-chatbot is deployed on servers managed or associated with OpenAI, based on the consistency of error messages and API behavior compared to other known OpenAI models.

6. **Versioning and Incremental Updates**: The model might represent an incremental update over GPT-4, perhaps a GPT-4.5, focusing on improved contextual understanding and interaction capabilities. This version might not be a major architectural leap but rather an optimization and refinement phase in the model's evolution.

7. **Operational Objectives**: The stealthy deployment on LMSYS suggests that one of OpenAI’s objectives could be conducting real-world testing without the hype and biases associated with a new model release. This allows them to collect genuine interaction data and user feedback, which is invaluable for iterative development.

8. **Competition and Benchmarking**: Hosting the model in a comparative environment like LMSYS's Arena (Battle) mode indicates an interest in benchmarking the model's performance against other LLMs in blinded tests, which can provide unbiased assessments of its capabilities relative to competitors.

9. **Rate Limiting and Resource Management**: The unique rate limits could imply a higher computational cost for running this model, suggesting more complex or resource-intensive processes under the hood than typical GPT-4 implementations.

This speculative profile paints gpt2-chatbot as a sophisticated, possibly intermediate update to existing OpenAI models, aimed at refining user interaction and processing capabilities while being strategically deployed to gather unbiassed user interaction data.
